## Welcome to my page

I am a repurposed math PhD, working in Algorithms and software leadership in the Bay Area. In the past I worked mainly in problems related to Fluid dynamics and Free boundary problems. My thesis was on the local and global well-posedness of the Two-Phase Stefan problem, which is a model for the interaction of two phases of a fluid, like ice and water, and the evolution of the interface that separates the two.

I am interested in anything related to mathematics, from numerical simulations of differential equations, to optimization, and lately Data Science. Any problem that can be modeled into a mathematical question, and that requires deep thinking and the development of new mathematical tools sparks my interest.

## My projects
_These are all half-baked ideas that get worked on whenever I have time_

- Bazaar of Dragons - _a marketplace for table top miniatures_
- Diamond Matching - _a model for estimating the right prize of diamonds_
- Singular limits in Liouville-type equations - _an extension to my undergraduate thesis_
- Hollow stars - _what happens inside a non-equilibrium star?_
- [My blog](./blog/blog.md) - Where I write about whatever with a random frequency
